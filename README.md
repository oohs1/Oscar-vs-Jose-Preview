How to install :
1. Download Setup file (Go to releases and click on tags then click on the most recent version and download the setup file)
2. Right Click on Oscar VS Jose PREVIEW Setup.EXE and click run as administrator (This is because the setup has to install important game assets)
3. If Windows SmartScreen pops up don't worry, this is because the setup file is unsigned and Windows thinks its from an unknown publisher.
